# Weather-App
I created a Weather Application using OpenWeather API to practice my skills. I built it on HTML, CSS, JS. 
in this App you can search by your city name and its weather information will be displayed.

Features:
It will display various stats;
1, Current Temperature (Celsius)
2, Weather
3, Minimum Temperature
4, Maximum Temperature
5, Humdity
6, Wind Speed

Thanks!
